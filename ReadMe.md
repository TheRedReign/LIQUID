Hello! This is the official documentation for the Discord bot LIQUID, created by RedReign.

First, to find out some of my basic commands you can run /help and select a category from the list.

If you require a full command list, that can be found in this repo (https://github.com/TheRedReign/LIQUID/blob/main/Commands%20List.text)

The Official Community & Support server can be joined through this link: https://discord.gg/jZbqmT8b5D

Thanks,
