Hello! This is the official documentation for the Discord Bot **LIQUID**, created by RedReign.

First, to find out some of my basic commands you can run /help and select a category from the list.

If you require a full command list, that can be found in **[this](https://github.com/TheRedReign/LIQUID/blob/main/Commands%20List.text)** repo. 

The Official Community & Support server can be joined through this **[link](https://discord.gg/jZbqmT8b5D)**.

Blacklist appeals and business inquiries can be sent to this email, <liquiddiscordbot@gmail.com>

Thanks,
    **- LIQUID Staff**
